Many defenders are unaware that several versions of PowerShell often exist on a host. If not uninstalled, they can still be used. Powershell event logging was introduced as a feature with Powershell 3.0 and forward. With that in mind, we can attempt to call Powershell version 2.0 or older. If successful, our actions from the shell will not be logged in Event Viewer.

## Downgrade Powershell

```ruby
Get-host
```

```ruby
powershell.exe -version 2
```


#### Net Commands Trick

If you believe the network defenders are actively logging/looking for any commands out of the normal, you can try this workaround to using net commands. Typing `net1` instead of `net` will execute the same functions without the potential trigger from the net string.
